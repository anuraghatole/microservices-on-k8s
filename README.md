# 🛠️ Cloud-Native Microservices Application with gRPC, Istio, mTLS & Observability

A production-grade, Kubernetes-based microservices application consisting of 10+ gRPC services, secured with strict mutual TLS (mTLS), monitored using Prometheus and Grafana, and deployed on a private Amazon EKS cluster. The infrastructure is fully automated using Terraform and the application is exposed securely through a custom domain: **[anuraghatole.me](https://anuraghatole.me)**.

---

## 📍 Overview

This project simulates a real-world cloud-native architecture where services communicate over high-performance gRPC and are managed via Istio's service mesh. With robust traffic control, observability tooling, and zero-trust security principles, this system demonstrates advanced Kubernetes, DevOps, and security practices for scalable, secure, and resilient deployments.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **10+ containerized microservices** built with gRPC for efficient, low-latency communication.
- 🔒 **Istio service mesh** managing traffic routing, load balancing, and advanced failure recovery.
- 🔐 **Strict mutual TLS (mTLS)** enabled between all services to enforce encrypted, authenticated communication.
- 📈 **Integrated observability** with Prometheus, Grafana, and Kiali to monitor real-time metrics, traffic flows, and service health.
- ☁️ **Production-ready deployment** on a private EKS cluster with network isolation and secure traffic flow.
- 🛡️ **Health checks, circuit breaking, and retry logic** implemented for resilient service behavior.
- 🌐 **Exposed frontend via Istio Ingress Gateway** mapped to a custom domain with load balancing.
- 🧱 **Infrastructure provisioned with Terraform** — from VPC to EKS, subnets, security groups, and routing.

## 🧠 What This Platform Delivers

It simulates a real startup-grade backend infrastructure. Here's what the system actually does:

- Hosts over 10 containerized microservices — each deployed with isolated config, ports, and Kubernetes settings.
- Uses gRPC across the services for ultra-low-latency communication, reducing overhead versus HTTP.
- Applies Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes to ensure only healthy services receive traffic.
- Deploys every service behind a ClusterIP, making them only accessible within the cluster — no unnecessary exposure.
- Injects Istio sidecars across the mesh with strict mTLS, ensuring every service call is encrypted and authenticated.
- Applies advanced traffic routing — VirtualService, DestinationRule, and Gateway configurations that support retry logic.
- Monitors every metric through Prometheus scraping Istio telemetry and application pods.
- Displays real-time dashboards in Grafana: request latency, error rate, memory usage, and more.
- Visualizes entire service mesh via Kiali — from service graphs to request flows and response times.
- Exposes only the frontend through Istio’s Ingress Gateway — mapped to a domain with a clean TLS termination.
- Runs in a private VPC subnet, with all pods secured via non-root access, dropped capabilities, and enforced resource limits.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform (AWS VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, EIP, Route Tables, Security Groups, EKS Cluster)
- **Container Orchestration:** Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)
- **Service Communication:** gRPC
- **Service Mesh:** Istio (sidecar injection, ingress gateway, mTLS, virtual services)
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Frontend Exposure:** Istio Ingress Gateway + AWS Load Balancer

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- All microservices are deployed as **Kubernetes Deployments and Services**, communicating internally using **ClusterIP** services and gRPC endpoints.
- Services reside in a **private subnet** within a custom VPC created using Terraform, ensuring strict access control and network isolation.
- **Istio sidecars** are automatically injected into each pod, enforcing traffic policy, mutual TLS, and telemetry collection.
- **Ingress Gateway** routes external traffic to internal services, maintaining load balancing and secure access through custom domain integration.
- **VirtualService and DestinationRule** objects define traffic flow, retries, and fault tolerance strategies per service.
- Application behavior is monitored and visualized via **Grafana dashboards**, **Kiali service map**, and **Prometheus metrics**, ensuring quick response to incidents.

## ⚙️ Infrastructure / Deployment

- Infrastructure is fully automated via **Terraform**:
  - VPC, subnets (private/public), NAT Gateway, route tables, internet gateway
  - EKS cluster provisioned in private subnet
- Application deployments include:
  - `Deployment.yaml` for each service with health checks and resource limits
  - `Service.yaml` for internal discovery
  - `VirtualService.yaml`, `DestinationRule.yaml` for Istio traffic control
  - `Gateway.yaml`, `Ingress.yaml` for frontend exposure
- Services communicate via **secure gRPC** using internal DNS
- Istio **sidecar injection** and **namespace-level labels** enforce mTLS and telemetry collection automatically
